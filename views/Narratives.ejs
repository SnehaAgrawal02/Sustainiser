                                 about the amount of waste her family generated. Susan started by making small changes, such
                                  as using reusable bags and containers, and gradually adopted more sustainable practices like
                                   composting and buying in bulk. She documented her experiences on social media, sharing tips 
                                   and challenges. Susan’s story inspired many of her followers to reduce their waste, creating
                                    a ripple effect of environmental consciousness.
